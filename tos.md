# What is this for?
This and the [privacy policy](policy.md) is simply made to both not get sued and to follow discord's verification guidelines.

## Firstly
This guideline includes the discord tos, more of an extension of it per say.

# Inviting
When you invite the bot you agree to it being able to record voice channels, 
send messages in channels, and change it's nickname.

# Recording
When recording you agree that the bot is allowed to record your voice, 
for other members a message is sent to the channel notifying them of this change.
